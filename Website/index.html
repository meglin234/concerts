	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<p>Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec developed a friendship through their project <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject" title="See the Dear Data project" style="color: #3b6269;">Dear Data</a>. Each week, for a year, 
				they collected and measured a particular type of data about their lives and used this data to create a visualization 
				on a postcard. Their goal was to show that instead of using data to become more efficient, we can use data to become 
				more humane and connect with ourselves and others at a deeper level.</p>
			<p>Having an interest in how people interact with data and their surroundings, I decided to collect data about how often I communicated 
				for a week and created my very own hand-drawn visualization. Since my data is about communication, a collection of interactions with 
				others that fit together, I decided to visualize my data as a collection of sounds that fit together to create music.</p>

			<h3>The Data</h3>
			<p>For one week, I recorded every time I communicated with someone. Therefore, the data only represents times I spoke or texted; it does not 
				include times when other people spoke to or texted me. For that week, I recorded the person I communicated with and if I spoke to or texted 
				them. I also noted what social media platform or messaging app I used, the day of the week, and time of day I communicated with them.</p>
			<p>Since there are only seven different notes on the staff in any given key, I organized my data into seven groups: roommate 1, roommate 2, brother, 
				parents, classmates, research group, and others. The other category includes group chats, my study abroad program, and strangers.</p>
			<p>Once who I communicated with was established, I moved on to how. Talk was easy, I either spoke to them in person or over the phone, and since the 
				purpose for communication was the same either way I decided not to distinguish between the two. Text on the other hand, is slightly more 
				complicated. The majority of the time I was simply texting over iMessage, however, communication changes when it's over social media. With 
				Instagram, for example, I&apos;ll direct message (dm) a meme or video to a friend with no accompanying text, and although the content of the dm 
				isn&apos;t mine, we are still communicating. This difference in communication styles led me to add different articulation to notes depending on what 
				messaging/social media app I used.</p>

			<h3>The Visualization </h3>
			<p>Different people, or groups of people, I communicated with are represented through different notes. The way I communicated with them, either 
				talk or text, is shown by the color of the note. Lastly, if I communicated with someone through text, the messaging/social media app is denoted 
				using articulation.</p>
			<p> - Each score is a different day</p>
			<p> - Each measure is an hour in the day</p>
			<p> - Each note is a 20-minute interval in the hour</p>
			<p>The time signature is in 3/4 because it allowed me to divide the hour into three 20-minute intervals, while keeping the beats quarter notes. 
				Plus, 3/4 is my favorite time signature so I had to make it the foundation of my conversations.</p>
			<p>If I communicated with someone within a 20-minute interval, or one beat, their note, color, and articulation was recorded as a quarter note. 
				If I communicated with two people during the 20-minute interval I used 8th notes (two notes in one beat) to distinguish them from each other. 
				There were a few cases where I communicated with more than two people in a 20-minute interval and they are recorded as 16th notes (four notes 
				in one beat). If I spoke with someone for more that the 20-minute interval I recorded it as a half note or a dotted half note (two beats in one note).</p>
			<p>Notes that are tied together or marked to be slurred show a conversation that bridged the hour mark or that was interrupted by my communicating 
				with someone else.</p>

			<h3>Conclusions</h3>
			<p>After collecting the data and creating visualizations, I can conclude that I communicate with roommate 2 the most. I am not surprised by this 
				finding since they are also my best friend, but it is quite interesting to see when we communicate and how. You may also notice that there are 
				only a few pink notes in the mornings, showing that I do not talk that much until the evening. This would be because I was either in class all 
				day or my roommates were in class all day.</p>
			<p>A few other things that might catch your attention:</p>
			<p> - My primary method of text communication is through iMessage</p>
			<p> - I always GroupMe my classmates</p>
			<p> - I tend to use Instagram at night and Twitter during the day</p>
			<p> - On Saturday nights my brother and I watch Moon Knight</p>
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<p>On Wednesday, I would usually have a research meeting from 12pm to 1pm. However, this particular Wednesday, I attended a training at the School 
				of Education on qualitative data methods with my research group from 10am to 3pm, so I spoke more than usual.</p>
			<p>On Friday and Saturday, both of my roommates were out of town, leaving me all alone with the cat. In hindsight, I could have included Sunny as 
				a &quot;person&quot; I communicate with, but I&apos;m not sure if I was actually communicating with him or if I was just speaking to myself. Plus, considering 
				the number of times I speak to him, I would have needed a whole other postcard just for him.</p>
