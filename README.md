## Bystander Effect Model - NetLogo 

(not currently compatible with NetLogo Web, updated version to come)

Agent Based Model that allows users to specify the number of bystanders present. The model uses data from violent incidents captured on CCTV in Copenhagen, Denmark, to show what percentage of bystanders intervene, each intervenerâ€™s demographic information, and details about the environment. The data is accessed from two CSV files.
